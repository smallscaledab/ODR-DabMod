Required dependencies:
======================

    * A C++11 capable compiler
    * Boost 1.41 or later
    * Optional UHD for USRP
    * Optional ZeroMQ http://www.zeromq.org
    * Optional FFTW 3.x (included KISS FFT is used as fallback)

Simple install procedure:
=========================

    % tar xjf odr-dabmod-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2      # Unpack the source
    % cd odr-dabmod-X.Y.Z                   # Change to the source directory
    % ./configure
                                            # Run the configure script
    % make                                  # Build ODR-DabMod
    [ as root ]
    % make install                          # Install ODR-DabMod

Configure options
=================
The configure script can be launch with a variety of options:

 --disable-zeromq       Disable ZeroMQ input (to be used with ODR-DabMux),
                        output and remotecontrol.
 --disable-output-uhd   Disable the binding to the UHD driver for USRPs

You have the choice between two FFT libraries: KISS FFT and FFTW. KISS FFT is a
proven library, but it's performance is worse than with the new FFTW. With KISS
FFT, you have the choice between using the normal version, or the SIMD
accelerated version, which is a bit faster. The corresponding options are:

 --enable-kiss-fft      Prefer KISS FFT over FFTW
 --enable-fft-simd      Enable SIMD instructions for KISS FFT

Debugging options: You should not enable debug if you need good performance.
By default, debug is disabled.
 --enable-debug         Do not compile with debugging, and enable optimisations
 --enable-trace         Create debugging files for each DSP block for data analysis

For more information, call:

    % ./configure --help

Nearly as simple install procedure using repository:
====================================================

    * Download and install dependencies as above
    * Clone the git repository
    * Bootstrap autotools:
        % ./bootstrap.sh
            In case this fails, try:
        % aclocal && automake --gnu --add-missing && autoconf
    * Then use ./configure as above
