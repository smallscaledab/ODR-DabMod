This TODO file lists ideas and features for future developments. They are
more or less ordered according to their benefit, but that is subjective
to some degree.

Unless written, no activity has been started on the topics.


TII implementation incorrect
----------------------------
The current TII implementation is wrong. There are two TII variants:
one according to spec, and the one that was implemented in early modulators
that ended up being used a lot even if not compatible with the spec.

ODR-DabMod should support both ideally.


EDI input
---------
Add support for EDI input, so that more multiplexers can be interfaced
to the modulator. Relevant spec: ETSI TS 102 693

It would be beneficial to write and EDI decoding library that can be re-used in
ODR-DabMux to add EDI input there too for encoders.

Initial work started in http://git.mpb.li/git/odr-edilib/


Review CicEq
------------
The CIC Equaliser was used for the USRP1 to compensate for spectrum flatness.
It is not documented, and its effect poorly explained. Review if still needed,
and document appropriately.


Add metadata to flowgraph
-------------------------
The flowgraph does not support metadata. This is why the timestamp has this
kludge with the delay queue, so that the timestamps are delayed properly
depending on what is included in the flowgraph.

Without metadata inside the flowgraph, it is more difficult to pipeline the DSP
processing to make use of many-core systems, because the timestamp cannot be
carried alongside the data it corresponds to.
